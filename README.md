Project Description
This is a personal portfolio website built with React.js to showcase my skills in modern web development. The site features a clean, responsive design and is built using functional components, state management with React hooks, and client-side routing. The portfolio is designed to demonstrate proficiency in modern CSS styling, fundamental JavaScript concepts, and professional Git practices. A key feature is the dynamic display of my GitHub repositories, powered by the fetch API.
